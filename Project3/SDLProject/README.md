<h1>Project 3: Lunar Lander</h1>

Project 3 was to make a playable game of lunar lander. In my version, the player controls the pokemon Jirachi using the `left` 
and `right` arrow keys. The goal is to have Jirachi land on the raised platform. 

Start the game by hitting `spacebar`. The game ends when Jirachi either lands on the goal (raised platform), or touches any
other block (the walls or floor). The game can be reset by pressing `spacebar`, and started again by pressing `spacebar` a second
time.

Jirachi's ribbons are not part of it's hitbox: it's body needs to touch the walls, floor, or goal for the game to end.
