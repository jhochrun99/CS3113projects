<h1>Project 2: Pong<h1>

<p>Project was to make a playable game of pong. In my version, the players control a charmander and a squirtle. Charmander is controlled 
with the `w` and `s` keys. Squirtle is controlled with the `up` and `down` arrow keys. </p>
<p>The ball is a pokeball. Start the game by hitting `spacebar`. The game ends when the pokeball hits the right or left sides of the
window, past either charmander or squirtle. To start another game, press `spacebar` again. </p>

<p>The pokeball can be sped up by pressing the `q` key. The speed resets each game. </p>
